# Hi, I'm Dash 👋

I'm a junior full-stack developer specialising in **TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node, and PostgreSQL**.  
I build clean, maintainable web applications with a focus on **data modelling, accessible UI, and structured delivery**.

I transitioned into engineering from a UX-focused product background, and now ship real projects end-to-end — including booking systems, client websites, internal dashboards, and my current full-stack work-in-progress platform (YWD).
